https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different parts of the world.[2][3][4] Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at English public schools during the 19th century.[5][6] The expansion and cultural influence of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence outside the directly controlled Empire.[7] By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional codes were already developing: Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order to maintain their heritage.[8] In 1888, The Football League was founded in England, becoming the first of many professional football associations. During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the most popular team sports in the world.[9]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"Games played in Mesoamerica with rubber balls by indigenous peoples are also well-documented as existing since before this time, but these had more similarities to basketball or volleyball, and no links have been found between such games and modern football sports. Northeastern American Indians, especially the Iroquois Confederation, played a game which made use of net racquets to throw and catch a small ball; however, although it is a ball-goal foot game, lacrosse (as its modern descendant is called) is likewise not usually classed as a form of ""football.""[citation needed]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"The Māori in New Zealand played a game called Ki-o-rahi consisting of teams of seven players play on a circular field divided into zones, and score points by touching the 'pou' (boundary markers) and hitting a central 'tupu' or target.[citation needed]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"The Middle Ages saw a huge rise in popularity of annual Shrovetide football matches throughout Europe, particularly in England. An early reference to a ball game played in Britain comes from the 9th-century Historia Brittonum, attributed to Nennius, which describes ""a party of boys ... playing at ball"".[30] References to a ball game played in northern France known as La Soule or Choule, in which the ball was propelled by hands, feet, and sticks,[31] date from the 12th century.[32]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"In 1314, Nicholas de Farndone, Lord Mayor of the City of London issued a decree banning football in the French used by the English upper classes at the time. A translation reads: ""[f]orasmuch as there is great noise in the city caused by hustling over large foot balls [rageries de grosses pelotes de pee][39] in the fields of the public from which many evils might arise which God forbid: we command and forbid on behalf of the king, on pain of imprisonment, such game to be used in the city in the future."" This is the earliest reference to football."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"There is also an account in Latin from the end of the 15th century of football being played at Caunton, Nottinghamshire. This is the first description of a ""kicking game"" and the first description of dribbling: ""[t]he game at which they had met for common recreation is called by some the foot-ball game. It is one in which young men, in country sport, propel a huge ball not by throwing it into the air but by striking it and rolling it along the ground, and that not with their hands but with their feet... kicking in opposite directions."" The chronicler gives the earliest reference to a football pitch, stating that: ""[t]he boundaries have been marked and the game had started.[37]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"While football continued to be played in various forms throughout Britain, its public schools (equivalent to private schools in other countries) are widely credited with four key achievements in the creation of modern football codes. First of all, the evidence suggests that they were important in taking football away from its ""mob"" form and turning it into an organised team sport. Second, many early descriptions of football and references to it were recorded by people who had studied at these schools. Third, it was teachers, students, and former students from these schools who first codified football games, to enable matches to be played between schools. Finally, it was at English public schools that the division between ""kicking"" and ""running"" (or ""carrying"") games first became clear."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"The earliest evidence that games resembling football were being played at English public schools – mainly attended by boys from the upper, upper-middle and professional classes – comes from the Vulgaria by William Herman in 1519. Herman had been headmaster at Eton and Winchester colleges and his Latin textbook includes a translation exercise with the phrase ""We wyll playe with a ball full of wynde"".[50]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"Richard Mulcaster, a student at Eton College in the early 16th century and later headmaster at other English schools, has been described as ""the greatest sixteenth Century advocate of football"".[51] Among his contributions are the earliest evidence of organised team football. Mulcaster's writings refer to teams (""sides"" and ""parties""), positions (""standings""), a referee (""judge over the parties"") and a coach ""(trayning maister)"". Mulcaster's ""footeball"" had evolved from the disordered and violent forms of traditional football:"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"English public schools were the first to codify football games. In particular, they devised the first offside rules, during the late 18th century.[57] In the earliest manifestations of these rules, players were ""off their side"" if they simply stood between the ball and the goal which was their objective. Players were not allowed to pass the ball forward, either by foot or by hand. They could only dribble with their feet, or advance the ball in a scrum or similar formation. However, offside laws began to diverge and develop differently at each school, as is shown by the rules of football from Winchester, Rugby, Harrow and Cheltenham, during between 1810 and 1850.[57] The first known codes – in the sense of a set of rules – were those of Eton in 1815[58] and Aldenham in 1825.[58])"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"Football was adopted by a number of public schools as a way of encouraging competitiveness and keeping youths fit. Each school drafted its own rules, which varied widely between different schools and were changed over time with each new intake of pupils. Two schools of thought developed regarding rules. Some schools favoured a game in which the ball could be carried (as at Rugby, Marlborough and Cheltenham), while others preferred a game where kicking and dribbling the ball was promoted (as at Eton, Harrow, Westminster and Charterhouse). The division into these two camps was partly the result of circumstances in which the games were played. For example, Charterhouse and Westminster at the time had restricted playing areas; the boys were confined to playing their ball game within the school cloisters, making it difficult for them to adopt rough and tumble running games.[citation needed]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"William Webb Ellis, a pupil at Rugby School, is said to have ""with a fine disregard for the rules of football, as played in his time [emphasis added], first took the ball in his arms and ran with it, thus creating the distinctive feature of the rugby game."" in 1823. This act is usually said to be the beginning of Rugby football, but there is little evidence that it occurred, and most sports historians believe the story to be apocryphal. The act of 'taking the ball in his arms' is often misinterpreted as 'picking the ball up' as it is widely believed that Webb Ellis' 'crime' was handling the ball, as in modern association football, however handling the ball at the time was often permitted and in some cases compulsory,[59] the rule for which Webb Ellis showed disregard was running forward with it as the rules of his time only allowed a player to retreat backwards or kick forwards."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"Apart from Rugby football, the public school codes have barely been played beyond the confines of each school's playing fields. However, many of them are still played at the schools which created them (see Surviving UK school games below)."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,The earliest known matches between public schools are as follows:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"Sports clubs dedicated to playing football began in the 18th century, for example London's Gymnastic Society which was founded in the mid-18th century and ceased playing matches in 1796.[64][62]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"The first documented club to bear in the title a reference to being a 'football club' were called ""The Foot-Ball Club"" who were located in Edinburgh, Scotland, during the period 1824–41.[65][66] The club forbade tripping but allowed pushing and holding and the picking up of the ball.[66]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,The earliest known matches involving non-public school clubs or institutions are as follows:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"During the nineteenth century, several codifications of the rules of football were made at the University of Cambridge, in order to enable students from different public schools to play each other. The Cambridge Rules of 1863 influenced the decision of Football Association to ban Rugby-style carrying of the ball in its own first set of laws.[101]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"By the late 1850s, many football clubs had been formed throughout the English-speaking world, to play various codes of football. Sheffield Football Club, founded in 1857 in the English city of Sheffield by Nathaniel Creswick and William Prest, was later recognised as the world's oldest club playing association football.[102] However, the club initially played its own code of football: the Sheffield rules. The code was largely independent of the public school rules, the most significant difference being the lack of an offside rule."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"The code was responsible for many innovations that later spread to association football. These included free kicks, corner kicks, handball, throw-ins and the crossbar.[103] By the 1870s they became the dominant code in the north and midlands of England. At this time a series of rule changes by both the London and Sheffield FAs gradually eroded the differences between the two games until the adoption of a common code in 1877."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"In July 1858, Tom Wills, an Australian-born cricketer educated at Rugby School in England, wrote a letter to Bell's Life in Victoria & Sporting Chronicle, calling for a ""foot-ball club"" with a ""code of laws"" to keep cricketers fit during winter.[104] This is considered by historians to be a defining moment in the creation of Australian rules football. Through publicity and personal contacts Wills was able to co-ordinate football matches in Melbourne that experimented with various rules,[105] the first of which was played on 31 July 1858. One week later, Wills umpired a schoolboys match between Melbourne Grammar School and Scotch College. Following these matches, organised football in Melbourne rapidly increased in popularity."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"Wills and others involved in these early matches formed the Melbourne Football Club (the oldest surviving Australian football club) on 14 May 1859. Club members Wills, William Hammersley, J. B. Thompson and Thomas H. Smith met with the intention of forming a set of rules that would be widely adopted by other clubs. The committee debated rules used in English public school games; Wills pushed for various rugby football rules he learnt during his schooling. The first rules share similarities with these games, and were shaped to suit to Australian conditions. H. C. A. Harrison, a seminal figure in Australian football, recalled that his cousin Wills wanted ""a game of our own"".[106] The code was distinctive in the prevalence of the mark, free kick, tackling, lack of an offside rule and that players were specifically penalised for throwing the ball."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"The Melbourne football rules were widely distributed and gradually adopted by the other Victorian clubs. The rules were updated several times during the 1860s to accommodate the rules of other influential Victorian football clubs. A significant redraft in 1866 by H. C. A. Harrison's committee accommodated the Geelong Football Club's rules, making the game then known as ""Victorian Rules"" increasingly distinct from other codes. It soon adopted cricket fields and an oval ball, used specialised goal and behind posts, and featured bouncing the ball while running and spectacular high marking. The game spread quickly to other Australian colonies. Outside its heartland in southern Australia, the code experienced a significant period of decline following World War I but has since grown throughout Australia and in other parts of the world, and the Australian Football League emerged as the dominant professional competition."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"During the early 1860s, there were increasing attempts in England to unify and reconcile the various public school games. In 1862, J. C. Thring, who had been one of the driving forces behind the original Cambridge Rules, was a master at Uppingham School and he issued his own rules of what he called ""The Simplest Game"" (these are also known as the Uppingham Rules). In early October 1863 another new revised version of the Cambridge Rules was drawn up by a seven member committee representing former pupils from Harrow, Shrewsbury, Eton, Rugby, Marlborough and Westminster."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"At the Freemasons' Tavern, Great Queen Street, London on the evening of 26 October 1863, representatives of several football clubs in the London Metropolitan area met for the inaugural meeting of The Football Association (FA). The aim of the Association was to establish a single unifying code and regulate the playing of the game among its members. Following the first meeting, the public schools were invited to join the association. All of them declined, except Charterhouse and Uppingham. In total, six meetings of the FA were held between October and December 1863. After the third meeting, a draft set of rules were published. However, at the beginning of the fourth meeting, attention was drawn to the recently published Cambridge Rules of 1863. The Cambridge rules differed from the draft FA rules in two significant areas; namely running with (carrying) the ball and hacking (kicking opposing players in the shins). The two contentious FA rules were as follows:"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"IX. A player shall be entitled to run with the ball towards his adversaries' goal if he makes a fair catch, or catches the ball on the first bound; but in case of a fair catch, if he makes his mark he shall not run. X. If any player shall run with the ball towards his adversaries' goal, any player on the opposite side shall be at liberty to charge, hold, trip or hack him, or to wrest the ball from him, but no player shall be held and hacked at the same time.[107]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"At the fifth meeting it was proposed that these two rules be removed. Most of the delegates supported this, but F. M. Campbell, the representative from Blackheath and the first FA treasurer, objected. He said: ""hacking is the true football"". However, the motion to ban running with the ball in hand and hacking was carried and Blackheath withdrew from the FA. After the final meeting on 8 December, the FA published the ""Laws of Football"", the first comprehensive set of rules for the game later known as Association Football. The term ""soccer"", in use since the late 19th century, derives from an Oxford University abbreviation of ""Association"".[108]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"The first FA rules still contained elements that are no longer part of association football, but which are still recognisable in other games (such as Australian football and rugby football): for instance, a player could make a fair catch and claim a mark, which entitled him to a free kick; and if a player touched the ball behind the opponents' goal line, his side was entitled to a free kick at goal, from 15 yards (13.5 metres) in front of the goal line."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"In Britain, by 1870, there were 49 clubs playing variations of the Rugby school game.[109] There were also ""rugby"" clubs in Ireland, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. However, there was no generally accepted set of rules for rugby until 1871, when 21 clubs from London came together to form the Rugby Football Union (RFU). The first official RFU rules were adopted in June 1871.[110] These rules allowed passing the ball. They also included the try, where touching the ball over the line allowed an attempt at goal, though drop-goals from marks and general play, and penalty conversions were still the main form of contest."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"As was the case in Britain, by the early 19th century, North American schools and universities played their own local games, between sides made up of students. For example, students at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire played a game called Old division football, a variant of the association football codes, as early as the 1820s.[48] They remained largely ""mob football"" style games, with huge numbers of players attempting to advance the ball into a goal area, often by any means necessary. Rules were simple, violence and injury were common.[47] The violence of these mob-style games led to widespread protests and a decision to abandon them. Yale University, under pressure from the city of New Haven, banned the play of all forms of football in 1860, while Harvard University followed suit in 1861.[47] In its place, two general types of football evolved: ""kicking"" games and ""running"" (or ""carrying"") games. A hybrid of the two, known as the ""Boston game"", was played by a group known as the Oneida Football Club. The club, considered by some historians as the first formal football club in the United States, was formed in 1862 by schoolboys who played the ""Boston game"" on Boston Common.[47][111] The game began to return to American college campuses by the late 1860s. The universities of Yale, Princeton (then known as the College of New Jersey), Rutgers, and Brown all began playing ""kicking"" games during this time. In 1867, Princeton used rules based on those of the English Football Association.[47]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"In 1880, Yale coach Walter Camp, who had become a fixture at the Massasoit House conventions where the rules were debated and changed, devised a number of major innovations. Camp's two most important rule changes that diverged the American game from rugby were replacing the scrummage with the line of scrimmage and the establishment of the down-and-distance rules.[119] American football still however remained a violent sport where collisions often led to serious injuries and sometimes even death.[120] This led U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt to hold a meeting with football representatives from Harvard, Yale, and Princeton on 9 October 1905, urging them to make drastic changes.[121] One rule change introduced in 1906, devised to open up the game and reduce injury, was the introduction of the legal forward pass. Though it was underutilised for years, this proved to be one of the most important rule changes in the establishment of the modern game.[122]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"Over the years, Canada absorbed some of the developments in American football in an effort to distinguish it from a more rugby-oriented game. In 1903, the Ontario Rugby Football Union adopted the Burnside rules, which implemented the line of scrimmage and down-and-distance system from American football, among others.[123] Canadian football then implemented the legal forward pass in 1929.[124] American and Canadian football remain different codes, stemming from rule changes that the American side of the border adopted but the Canadian side has not."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"By the 1870s, Rugby and Association football had started to become popular in Ireland. Trinity College Dublin was an early stronghold of Rugby (see the Developments in the 1850s section, above). The rules of the English FA were being distributed widely. Traditional forms of caid had begun to give way to a ""rough-and-tumble game"" which allowed tripping."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"There was no serious attempt to unify and codify Irish varieties of football, until the establishment of the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) in 1884. The GAA sought to promote traditional Irish sports, such as hurling and to reject imported games like Rugby and Association football. The first Gaelic football rules were drawn up by Maurice Davin and published in the United Ireland magazine on 7 February 1887.[125] Davin's rules showed the influence of games such as hurling and a desire to formalise a distinctly Irish code of football. The prime example of this differentiation was the lack of an offside rule (an attribute which, for many years, was shared only by other Irish games like hurling, and by Australian rules football)."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"The International Rugby Football Board (IRFB) was founded in 1886,[126] but rifts were beginning to emerge in the code. Professionalism had already begun to creep into the various codes of football."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"In England, by the 1890s, a long-standing Rugby Football Union ban on professional players was causing regional tensions within rugby football, as many players in northern England were working class and could not afford to take time off to train, travel, play and recover from injuries. This was not very different from what had occurred ten years earlier in soccer in Northern England but the authorities reacted very differently in the RFU, attempting to alienate the working class support in Northern England. In 1895, following a dispute about a player being paid broken time payments, which replaced wages lost as a result of playing rugby, representatives of the northern clubs met in Huddersfield to form the Northern Rugby Football Union (NRFU). The new body initially permitted only various types of player wage replacements. However, within two years, NRFU players could be paid, but they were required to have a job outside sport."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"Over time, the RFU form of rugby, played by clubs which remained members of national federations affiliated to the IRFB, became known as rugby union."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"The need for a single body to oversee association football had become apparent by the beginning of the 20th century, with the increasing popularity of international fixtures. The English Football Association had chaired many discussions on setting up an international body, but was perceived as making no progress. It fell to associations from seven other European countries: France, Belgium, Denmark, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland, to form an international association. The Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) was founded in Paris on 21 May 1904.[127] Its first president was Robert Guérin.[127] The French name and acronym has remained, even outside French-speaking countries."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"In each of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada, one football code is known solely as ""football"", while the others generally require a qualifier. In New Zealand, ""football"" historically referred to rugby union, but more recently may be used unqualified to refer to association football. The sport meant by the word ""football"" in Australia is either Australian rules football or rugby league, depending on local popularity (which largely conforms to the Barassi Line). In francophone Quebec, where Canadian football is more popular, the Canadian code is known as le football while American football is known as le football américain and association football is known as le soccer.[129]"

https://www.britannica.com/sports/football-soccer,"Modern football originated in Britain in the 19th century. Though “folk football” had been played since medieval times with varying rules, the game began to be standardized when it was taken up as a winter game at public schools. The Football Association, formed in 1863, codified the rules of the game and hosted the first cup competition between regional football clubs in Britain."
https://www.britannica.com/sports/football-soccer,"football, also called association football or soccer, game in which two teams of 11 players, using any part of their bodies except their hands and arms, try to maneuver the ball into the opposing team’s goal. Only the goalkeeper is permitted to handle the ball and may do so only within the penalty area surrounding the goal. The team that scores more goals wins."
https://www.britannica.com/sports/football-soccer,"Modern football originated in Britain in the 19th century. Since before medieval times, “folk football” games had been played in towns and villages according to local customs and with a minimum of rules. Industrialization and urbanization, which reduced the amount of leisure time and space available to the working class, combined with a history of legal prohibitions against particularly violent and destructive forms of folk football to undermine the game’s status from the early 19th century onward. However, football was taken up as a winter game between residence houses at public (independent) schools such as Winchester, Charterhouse, and Eton. Each school had its own rules; some allowed limited handling of the ball and others did not. The variance in rules made it difficult for public schoolboys entering university to continue playing except with former schoolmates. As early as 1843 an attempt to standardize and codify the rules of play was made at the University of Cambridge, whose students joined most public schools in 1848 in adopting these “Cambridge rules,” which were further spread by Cambridge graduates who formed football clubs. In 1863 a series of meetings involving clubs from metropolitan London and surrounding counties produced the printed rules of football, which prohibited the carrying of the ball. Thus, the “handling” game of rugby remained outside the newly formed Football Association (FA). Indeed, by 1870 all handling of the ball except by the goalkeeper was prohibited by the FA."
https://www.britannica.com/sports/football-soccer,"The new rules were not universally accepted in Britain, however; many clubs retained their own rules, especially in and around Sheffield. Although this northern English city was the home of the first provincial club to join the FA, in 1867 it also gave birth to the Sheffield Football Association, the forerunner of later county associations. Sheffield and London clubs played two matches against each other in 1866, and a year later a match pitting a club from Middlesex against one from Kent and Surrey was played under the revised rules. In 1871 15 FA clubs accepted an invitation to enter a cup competition and to contribute to the purchase of a trophy. By 1877 the associations of Great Britain had agreed upon a uniform code, 43 clubs were in competition, and the London clubs’ initial dominance had diminished."

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different parts of the world.[2][3][4] Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at English public schools during the 19th century.[5][6] The expansion and cultural influence of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence outside the directly controlled Empire.[7] By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional codes were already developing: Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order to maintain their heritage.[8] In 1888, The Football League was founded in England, becoming the first of many professional football associations. During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the most popular team sports in the world.[9]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"Games played in Mesoamerica with rubber balls by indigenous peoples are also well-documented as existing since before this time, but these had more similarities to basketball or volleyball, and no links have been found between such games and modern football sports. Northeastern American Indians, especially the Iroquois Confederation, played a game which made use of net racquets to throw and catch a small ball; however, although it is a ball-goal foot game, lacrosse (as its modern descendant is called) is likewise not usually classed as a form of ""football.""[citation needed]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"The Māori in New Zealand played a game called Ki-o-rahi consisting of teams of seven players play on a circular field divided into zones, and score points by touching the 'pou' (boundary markers) and hitting a central 'tupu' or target.[citation needed]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"The Middle Ages saw a huge rise in popularity of annual Shrovetide football matches throughout Europe, particularly in England. An early reference to a ball game played in Britain comes from the 9th-century Historia Brittonum, attributed to Nennius, which describes ""a party of boys ... playing at ball"".[30] References to a ball game played in northern France known as La Soule or Choule, in which the ball was propelled by hands, feet, and sticks,[31] date from the 12th century.[32]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"In 1314, Nicholas de Farndone, Lord Mayor of the City of London issued a decree banning football in the French used by the English upper classes at the time. A translation reads: ""[f]orasmuch as there is great noise in the city caused by hustling over large foot balls [rageries de grosses pelotes de pee][39] in the fields of the public from which many evils might arise which God forbid: we command and forbid on behalf of the king, on pain of imprisonment, such game to be used in the city in the future."" This is the earliest reference to football."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"There is also an account in Latin from the end of the 15th century of football being played at Caunton, Nottinghamshire. This is the first description of a ""kicking game"" and the first description of dribbling: ""[t]he game at which they had met for common recreation is called by some the foot-ball game. It is one in which young men, in country sport, propel a huge ball not by throwing it into the air but by striking it and rolling it along the ground, and that not with their hands but with their feet... kicking in opposite directions."" The chronicler gives the earliest reference to a football pitch, stating that: ""[t]he boundaries have been marked and the game had started.[37]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"While football continued to be played in various forms throughout Britain, its public schools (equivalent to private schools in other countries) are widely credited with four key achievements in the creation of modern football codes. First of all, the evidence suggests that they were important in taking football away from its ""mob"" form and turning it into an organised team sport. Second, many early descriptions of football and references to it were recorded by people who had studied at these schools. Third, it was teachers, students, and former students from these schools who first codified football games, to enable matches to be played between schools. Finally, it was at English public schools that the division between ""kicking"" and ""running"" (or ""carrying"") games first became clear."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"The earliest evidence that games resembling football were being played at English public schools – mainly attended by boys from the upper, upper-middle and professional classes – comes from the Vulgaria by William Herman in 1519. Herman had been headmaster at Eton and Winchester colleges and his Latin textbook includes a translation exercise with the phrase ""We wyll playe with a ball full of wynde"".[50]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"Richard Mulcaster, a student at Eton College in the early 16th century and later headmaster at other English schools, has been described as ""the greatest sixteenth Century advocate of football"".[51] Among his contributions are the earliest evidence of organised team football. Mulcaster's writings refer to teams (""sides"" and ""parties""), positions (""standings""), a referee (""judge over the parties"") and a coach ""(trayning maister)"". Mulcaster's ""footeball"" had evolved from the disordered and violent forms of traditional football:"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"English public schools were the first to codify football games. In particular, they devised the first offside rules, during the late 18th century.[57] In the earliest manifestations of these rules, players were ""off their side"" if they simply stood between the ball and the goal which was their objective. Players were not allowed to pass the ball forward, either by foot or by hand. They could only dribble with their feet, or advance the ball in a scrum or similar formation. However, offside laws began to diverge and develop differently at each school, as is shown by the rules of football from Winchester, Rugby, Harrow and Cheltenham, during between 1810 and 1850.[57] The first known codes – in the sense of a set of rules – were those of Eton in 1815[58] and Aldenham in 1825.[58])"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"Football was adopted by a number of public schools as a way of encouraging competitiveness and keeping youths fit. Each school drafted its own rules, which varied widely between different schools and were changed over time with each new intake of pupils. Two schools of thought developed regarding rules. Some schools favoured a game in which the ball could be carried (as at Rugby, Marlborough and Cheltenham), while others preferred a game where kicking and dribbling the ball was promoted (as at Eton, Harrow, Westminster and Charterhouse). The division into these two camps was partly the result of circumstances in which the games were played. For example, Charterhouse and Westminster at the time had restricted playing areas; the boys were confined to playing their ball game within the school cloisters, making it difficult for them to adopt rough and tumble running games.[citation needed]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"William Webb Ellis, a pupil at Rugby School, is said to have ""with a fine disregard for the rules of football, as played in his time [emphasis added], first took the ball in his arms and ran with it, thus creating the distinctive feature of the rugby game."" in 1823. This act is usually said to be the beginning of Rugby football, but there is little evidence that it occurred, and most sports historians believe the story to be apocryphal. The act of 'taking the ball in his arms' is often misinterpreted as 'picking the ball up' as it is widely believed that Webb Ellis' 'crime' was handling the ball, as in modern association football, however handling the ball at the time was often permitted and in some cases compulsory,[59] the rule for which Webb Ellis showed disregard was running forward with it as the rules of his time only allowed a player to retreat backwards or kick forwards."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"Apart from Rugby football, the public school codes have barely been played beyond the confines of each school's playing fields. However, many of them are still played at the schools which created them (see Surviving UK school games below)."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,The earliest known matches between public schools are as follows:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"Sports clubs dedicated to playing football began in the 18th century, for example London's Gymnastic Society which was founded in the mid-18th century and ceased playing matches in 1796.[64][62]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"The first documented club to bear in the title a reference to being a 'football club' were called ""The Foot-Ball Club"" who were located in Edinburgh, Scotland, during the period 1824–41.[65][66] The club forbade tripping but allowed pushing and holding and the picking up of the ball.[66]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,The earliest known matches involving non-public school clubs or institutions are as follows:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"During the nineteenth century, several codifications of the rules of football were made at the University of Cambridge, in order to enable students from different public schools to play each other. The Cambridge Rules of 1863 influenced the decision of Football Association to ban Rugby-style carrying of the ball in its own first set of laws.[101]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"By the late 1850s, many football clubs had been formed throughout the English-speaking world, to play various codes of football. Sheffield Football Club, founded in 1857 in the English city of Sheffield by Nathaniel Creswick and William Prest, was later recognised as the world's oldest club playing association football.[102] However, the club initially played its own code of football: the Sheffield rules. The code was largely independent of the public school rules, the most significant difference being the lack of an offside rule."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"The code was responsible for many innovations that later spread to association football. These included free kicks, corner kicks, handball, throw-ins and the crossbar.[103] By the 1870s they became the dominant code in the north and midlands of England. At this time a series of rule changes by both the London and Sheffield FAs gradually eroded the differences between the two games until the adoption of a common code in 1877."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"In July 1858, Tom Wills, an Australian-born cricketer educated at Rugby School in England, wrote a letter to Bell's Life in Victoria & Sporting Chronicle, calling for a ""foot-ball club"" with a ""code of laws"" to keep cricketers fit during winter.[104] This is considered by historians to be a defining moment in the creation of Australian rules football. Through publicity and personal contacts Wills was able to co-ordinate football matches in Melbourne that experimented with various rules,[105] the first of which was played on 31 July 1858. One week later, Wills umpired a schoolboys match between Melbourne Grammar School and Scotch College. Following these matches, organised football in Melbourne rapidly increased in popularity."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"Wills and others involved in these early matches formed the Melbourne Football Club (the oldest surviving Australian football club) on 14 May 1859. Club members Wills, William Hammersley, J. B. Thompson and Thomas H. Smith met with the intention of forming a set of rules that would be widely adopted by other clubs. The committee debated rules used in English public school games; Wills pushed for various rugby football rules he learnt during his schooling. The first rules share similarities with these games, and were shaped to suit to Australian conditions. H. C. A. Harrison, a seminal figure in Australian football, recalled that his cousin Wills wanted ""a game of our own"".[106] The code was distinctive in the prevalence of the mark, free kick, tackling, lack of an offside rule and that players were specifically penalised for throwing the ball."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"The Melbourne football rules were widely distributed and gradually adopted by the other Victorian clubs. The rules were updated several times during the 1860s to accommodate the rules of other influential Victorian football clubs. A significant redraft in 1866 by H. C. A. Harrison's committee accommodated the Geelong Football Club's rules, making the game then known as ""Victorian Rules"" increasingly distinct from other codes. It soon adopted cricket fields and an oval ball, used specialised goal and behind posts, and featured bouncing the ball while running and spectacular high marking. The game spread quickly to other Australian colonies. Outside its heartland in southern Australia, the code experienced a significant period of decline following World War I but has since grown throughout Australia and in other parts of the world, and the Australian Football League emerged as the dominant professional competition."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"During the early 1860s, there were increasing attempts in England to unify and reconcile the various public school games. In 1862, J. C. Thring, who had been one of the driving forces behind the original Cambridge Rules, was a master at Uppingham School and he issued his own rules of what he called ""The Simplest Game"" (these are also known as the Uppingham Rules). In early October 1863 another new revised version of the Cambridge Rules was drawn up by a seven member committee representing former pupils from Harrow, Shrewsbury, Eton, Rugby, Marlborough and Westminster."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"At the Freemasons' Tavern, Great Queen Street, London on the evening of 26 October 1863, representatives of several football clubs in the London Metropolitan area met for the inaugural meeting of The Football Association (FA). The aim of the Association was to establish a single unifying code and regulate the playing of the game among its members. Following the first meeting, the public schools were invited to join the association. All of them declined, except Charterhouse and Uppingham. In total, six meetings of the FA were held between October and December 1863. After the third meeting, a draft set of rules were published. However, at the beginning of the fourth meeting, attention was drawn to the recently published Cambridge Rules of 1863. The Cambridge rules differed from the draft FA rules in two significant areas; namely running with (carrying) the ball and hacking (kicking opposing players in the shins). The two contentious FA rules were as follows:"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"IX. A player shall be entitled to run with the ball towards his adversaries' goal if he makes a fair catch, or catches the ball on the first bound; but in case of a fair catch, if he makes his mark he shall not run. X. If any player shall run with the ball towards his adversaries' goal, any player on the opposite side shall be at liberty to charge, hold, trip or hack him, or to wrest the ball from him, but no player shall be held and hacked at the same time.[107]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"At the fifth meeting it was proposed that these two rules be removed. Most of the delegates supported this, but F. M. Campbell, the representative from Blackheath and the first FA treasurer, objected. He said: ""hacking is the true football"". However, the motion to ban running with the ball in hand and hacking was carried and Blackheath withdrew from the FA. After the final meeting on 8 December, the FA published the ""Laws of Football"", the first comprehensive set of rules for the game later known as Association Football. The term ""soccer"", in use since the late 19th century, derives from an Oxford University abbreviation of ""Association"".[108]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"The first FA rules still contained elements that are no longer part of association football, but which are still recognisable in other games (such as Australian football and rugby football): for instance, a player could make a fair catch and claim a mark, which entitled him to a free kick; and if a player touched the ball behind the opponents' goal line, his side was entitled to a free kick at goal, from 15 yards (13.5 metres) in front of the goal line."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"In Britain, by 1870, there were 49 clubs playing variations of the Rugby school game.[109] There were also ""rugby"" clubs in Ireland, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. However, there was no generally accepted set of rules for rugby until 1871, when 21 clubs from London came together to form the Rugby Football Union (RFU). The first official RFU rules were adopted in June 1871.[110] These rules allowed passing the ball. They also included the try, where touching the ball over the line allowed an attempt at goal, though drop-goals from marks and general play, and penalty conversions were still the main form of contest."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"As was the case in Britain, by the early 19th century, North American schools and universities played their own local games, between sides made up of students. For example, students at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire played a game called Old division football, a variant of the association football codes, as early as the 1820s.[48] They remained largely ""mob football"" style games, with huge numbers of players attempting to advance the ball into a goal area, often by any means necessary. Rules were simple, violence and injury were common.[47] The violence of these mob-style games led to widespread protests and a decision to abandon them. Yale University, under pressure from the city of New Haven, banned the play of all forms of football in 1860, while Harvard University followed suit in 1861.[47] In its place, two general types of football evolved: ""kicking"" games and ""running"" (or ""carrying"") games. A hybrid of the two, known as the ""Boston game"", was played by a group known as the Oneida Football Club. The club, considered by some historians as the first formal football club in the United States, was formed in 1862 by schoolboys who played the ""Boston game"" on Boston Common.[47][111] The game began to return to American college campuses by the late 1860s. The universities of Yale, Princeton (then known as the College of New Jersey), Rutgers, and Brown all began playing ""kicking"" games during this time. In 1867, Princeton used rules based on those of the English Football Association.[47]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"In 1880, Yale coach Walter Camp, who had become a fixture at the Massasoit House conventions where the rules were debated and changed, devised a number of major innovations. Camp's two most important rule changes that diverged the American game from rugby were replacing the scrummage with the line of scrimmage and the establishment of the down-and-distance rules.[119] American football still however remained a violent sport where collisions often led to serious injuries and sometimes even death.[120] This led U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt to hold a meeting with football representatives from Harvard, Yale, and Princeton on 9 October 1905, urging them to make drastic changes.[121] One rule change introduced in 1906, devised to open up the game and reduce injury, was the introduction of the legal forward pass. Though it was underutilised for years, this proved to be one of the most important rule changes in the establishment of the modern game.[122]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"Over the years, Canada absorbed some of the developments in American football in an effort to distinguish it from a more rugby-oriented game. In 1903, the Ontario Rugby Football Union adopted the Burnside rules, which implemented the line of scrimmage and down-and-distance system from American football, among others.[123] Canadian football then implemented the legal forward pass in 1929.[124] American and Canadian football remain different codes, stemming from rule changes that the American side of the border adopted but the Canadian side has not."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"By the 1870s, Rugby and Association football had started to become popular in Ireland. Trinity College Dublin was an early stronghold of Rugby (see the Developments in the 1850s section, above). The rules of the English FA were being distributed widely. Traditional forms of caid had begun to give way to a ""rough-and-tumble game"" which allowed tripping."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"There was no serious attempt to unify and codify Irish varieties of football, until the establishment of the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) in 1884. The GAA sought to promote traditional Irish sports, such as hurling and to reject imported games like Rugby and Association football. The first Gaelic football rules were drawn up by Maurice Davin and published in the United Ireland magazine on 7 February 1887.[125] Davin's rules showed the influence of games such as hurling and a desire to formalise a distinctly Irish code of football. The prime example of this differentiation was the lack of an offside rule (an attribute which, for many years, was shared only by other Irish games like hurling, and by Australian rules football)."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"The International Rugby Football Board (IRFB) was founded in 1886,[126] but rifts were beginning to emerge in the code. Professionalism had already begun to creep into the various codes of football."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"In England, by the 1890s, a long-standing Rugby Football Union ban on professional players was causing regional tensions within rugby football, as many players in northern England were working class and could not afford to take time off to train, travel, play and recover from injuries. This was not very different from what had occurred ten years earlier in soccer in Northern England but the authorities reacted very differently in the RFU, attempting to alienate the working class support in Northern England. In 1895, following a dispute about a player being paid broken time payments, which replaced wages lost as a result of playing rugby, representatives of the northern clubs met in Huddersfield to form the Northern Rugby Football Union (NRFU). The new body initially permitted only various types of player wage replacements. However, within two years, NRFU players could be paid, but they were required to have a job outside sport."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"Over time, the RFU form of rugby, played by clubs which remained members of national federations affiliated to the IRFB, became known as rugby union."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"The need for a single body to oversee association football had become apparent by the beginning of the 20th century, with the increasing popularity of international fixtures. The English Football Association had chaired many discussions on setting up an international body, but was perceived as making no progress. It fell to associations from seven other European countries: France, Belgium, Denmark, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland, to form an international association. The Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) was founded in Paris on 21 May 1904.[127] Its first president was Robert Guérin.[127] The French name and acronym has remained, even outside French-speaking countries."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"In each of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada, one football code is known solely as ""football"", while the others generally require a qualifier. In New Zealand, ""football"" historically referred to rugby union, but more recently may be used unqualified to refer to association football. The sport meant by the word ""football"" in Australia is either Australian rules football or rugby league, depending on local popularity (which largely conforms to the Barassi Line). In francophone Quebec, where Canadian football is more popular, the Canadian code is known as le football while American football is known as le football américain and association football is known as le soccer.[129]"

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different parts of the world.[2][3][4] Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at English public schools during the 19th century.[5][6] The expansion and cultural influence of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence outside the directly controlled Empire.[7] By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional codes were already developing: Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order to maintain their heritage.[8] In 1888, The Football League was founded in England, becoming the first of many professional football associations. During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the most popular team sports in the world.[9]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"Games played in Mesoamerica with rubber balls by indigenous peoples are also well-documented as existing since before this time, but these had more similarities to basketball or volleyball, and no links have been found between such games and modern football sports. Northeastern American Indians, especially the Iroquois Confederation, played a game which made use of net racquets to throw and catch a small ball; however, although it is a ball-goal foot game, lacrosse (as its modern descendant is called) is likewise not usually classed as a form of ""football.""[citation needed]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"The Māori in New Zealand played a game called Ki-o-rahi consisting of teams of seven players play on a circular field divided into zones, and score points by touching the 'pou' (boundary markers) and hitting a central 'tupu' or target.[citation needed]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"The Middle Ages saw a huge rise in popularity of annual Shrovetide football matches throughout Europe, particularly in England. An early reference to a ball game played in Britain comes from the 9th-century Historia Brittonum, attributed to Nennius, which describes ""a party of boys ... playing at ball"".[30] References to a ball game played in northern France known as La Soule or Choule, in which the ball was propelled by hands, feet, and sticks,[31] date from the 12th century.[32]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"In 1314, Nicholas de Farndone, Lord Mayor of the City of London issued a decree banning football in the French used by the English upper classes at the time. A translation reads: ""[f]orasmuch as there is great noise in the city caused by hustling over large foot balls [rageries de grosses pelotes de pee][39] in the fields of the public from which many evils might arise which God forbid: we command and forbid on behalf of the king, on pain of imprisonment, such game to be used in the city in the future."" This is the earliest reference to football."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"There is also an account in Latin from the end of the 15th century of football being played at Caunton, Nottinghamshire. This is the first description of a ""kicking game"" and the first description of dribbling: ""[t]he game at which they had met for common recreation is called by some the foot-ball game. It is one in which young men, in country sport, propel a huge ball not by throwing it into the air but by striking it and rolling it along the ground, and that not with their hands but with their feet... kicking in opposite directions."" The chronicler gives the earliest reference to a football pitch, stating that: ""[t]he boundaries have been marked and the game had started.[37]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"While football continued to be played in various forms throughout Britain, its public schools (equivalent to private schools in other countries) are widely credited with four key achievements in the creation of modern football codes. First of all, the evidence suggests that they were important in taking football away from its ""mob"" form and turning it into an organised team sport. Second, many early descriptions of football and references to it were recorded by people who had studied at these schools. Third, it was teachers, students, and former students from these schools who first codified football games, to enable matches to be played between schools. Finally, it was at English public schools that the division between ""kicking"" and ""running"" (or ""carrying"") games first became clear."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"The earliest evidence that games resembling football were being played at English public schools – mainly attended by boys from the upper, upper-middle and professional classes – comes from the Vulgaria by William Herman in 1519. Herman had been headmaster at Eton and Winchester colleges and his Latin textbook includes a translation exercise with the phrase ""We wyll playe with a ball full of wynde"".[50]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"Richard Mulcaster, a student at Eton College in the early 16th century and later headmaster at other English schools, has been described as ""the greatest sixteenth Century advocate of football"".[51] Among his contributions are the earliest evidence of organised team football. Mulcaster's writings refer to teams (""sides"" and ""parties""), positions (""standings""), a referee (""judge over the parties"") and a coach ""(trayning maister)"". Mulcaster's ""footeball"" had evolved from the disordered and violent forms of traditional football:"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"English public schools were the first to codify football games. In particular, they devised the first offside rules, during the late 18th century.[57] In the earliest manifestations of these rules, players were ""off their side"" if they simply stood between the ball and the goal which was their objective. Players were not allowed to pass the ball forward, either by foot or by hand. They could only dribble with their feet, or advance the ball in a scrum or similar formation. However, offside laws began to diverge and develop differently at each school, as is shown by the rules of football from Winchester, Rugby, Harrow and Cheltenham, during between 1810 and 1850.[57] The first known codes – in the sense of a set of rules – were those of Eton in 1815[58] and Aldenham in 1825.[58])"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"Football was adopted by a number of public schools as a way of encouraging competitiveness and keeping youths fit. Each school drafted its own rules, which varied widely between different schools and were changed over time with each new intake of pupils. Two schools of thought developed regarding rules. Some schools favoured a game in which the ball could be carried (as at Rugby, Marlborough and Cheltenham), while others preferred a game where kicking and dribbling the ball was promoted (as at Eton, Harrow, Westminster and Charterhouse). The division into these two camps was partly the result of circumstances in which the games were played. For example, Charterhouse and Westminster at the time had restricted playing areas; the boys were confined to playing their ball game within the school cloisters, making it difficult for them to adopt rough and tumble running games.[citation needed]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"William Webb Ellis, a pupil at Rugby School, is said to have ""with a fine disregard for the rules of football, as played in his time [emphasis added], first took the ball in his arms and ran with it, thus creating the distinctive feature of the rugby game."" in 1823. This act is usually said to be the beginning of Rugby football, but there is little evidence that it occurred, and most sports historians believe the story to be apocryphal. The act of 'taking the ball in his arms' is often misinterpreted as 'picking the ball up' as it is widely believed that Webb Ellis' 'crime' was handling the ball, as in modern association football, however handling the ball at the time was often permitted and in some cases compulsory,[59] the rule for which Webb Ellis showed disregard was running forward with it as the rules of his time only allowed a player to retreat backwards or kick forwards."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"Apart from Rugby football, the public school codes have barely been played beyond the confines of each school's playing fields. However, many of them are still played at the schools which created them (see Surviving UK school games below)."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,The earliest known matches between public schools are as follows:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"Sports clubs dedicated to playing football began in the 18th century, for example London's Gymnastic Society which was founded in the mid-18th century and ceased playing matches in 1796.[64][62]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"The first documented club to bear in the title a reference to being a 'football club' were called ""The Foot-Ball Club"" who were located in Edinburgh, Scotland, during the period 1824–41.[65][66] The club forbade tripping but allowed pushing and holding and the picking up of the ball.[66]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,The earliest known matches involving non-public school clubs or institutions are as follows:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"During the nineteenth century, several codifications of the rules of football were made at the University of Cambridge, in order to enable students from different public schools to play each other. The Cambridge Rules of 1863 influenced the decision of Football Association to ban Rugby-style carrying of the ball in its own first set of laws.[101]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"By the late 1850s, many football clubs had been formed throughout the English-speaking world, to play various codes of football. Sheffield Football Club, founded in 1857 in the English city of Sheffield by Nathaniel Creswick and William Prest, was later recognised as the world's oldest club playing association football.[102] However, the club initially played its own code of football: the Sheffield rules. The code was largely independent of the public school rules, the most significant difference being the lack of an offside rule."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"The code was responsible for many innovations that later spread to association football. These included free kicks, corner kicks, handball, throw-ins and the crossbar.[103] By the 1870s they became the dominant code in the north and midlands of England. At this time a series of rule changes by both the London and Sheffield FAs gradually eroded the differences between the two games until the adoption of a common code in 1877."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"In July 1858, Tom Wills, an Australian-born cricketer educated at Rugby School in England, wrote a letter to Bell's Life in Victoria & Sporting Chronicle, calling for a ""foot-ball club"" with a ""code of laws"" to keep cricketers fit during winter.[104] This is considered by historians to be a defining moment in the creation of Australian rules football. Through publicity and personal contacts Wills was able to co-ordinate football matches in Melbourne that experimented with various rules,[105] the first of which was played on 31 July 1858. One week later, Wills umpired a schoolboys match between Melbourne Grammar School and Scotch College. Following these matches, organised football in Melbourne rapidly increased in popularity."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"Wills and others involved in these early matches formed the Melbourne Football Club (the oldest surviving Australian football club) on 14 May 1859. Club members Wills, William Hammersley, J. B. Thompson and Thomas H. Smith met with the intention of forming a set of rules that would be widely adopted by other clubs. The committee debated rules used in English public school games; Wills pushed for various rugby football rules he learnt during his schooling. The first rules share similarities with these games, and were shaped to suit to Australian conditions. H. C. A. Harrison, a seminal figure in Australian football, recalled that his cousin Wills wanted ""a game of our own"".[106] The code was distinctive in the prevalence of the mark, free kick, tackling, lack of an offside rule and that players were specifically penalised for throwing the ball."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"The Melbourne football rules were widely distributed and gradually adopted by the other Victorian clubs. The rules were updated several times during the 1860s to accommodate the rules of other influential Victorian football clubs. A significant redraft in 1866 by H. C. A. Harrison's committee accommodated the Geelong Football Club's rules, making the game then known as ""Victorian Rules"" increasingly distinct from other codes. It soon adopted cricket fields and an oval ball, used specialised goal and behind posts, and featured bouncing the ball while running and spectacular high marking. The game spread quickly to other Australian colonies. Outside its heartland in southern Australia, the code experienced a significant period of decline following World War I but has since grown throughout Australia and in other parts of the world, and the Australian Football League emerged as the dominant professional competition."

The first Gaelic football rules were drawn up by Maurice Davin and published in the United Ireland magazine on 7 February 1887.[125] Davin's rules showed the influence of games such as hurling and a desire to formalise a distinctly Irish code of football. The prime example of this differentiation was the lack of an offside rule (an attribute which, for many years, was shared only by other Irish games like hurling, and by Australian rules football)."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"The International Rugby Football Board (IRFB) was founded in 1886,[126] but rifts were beginning to emerge in the code. Professionalism had already begun to creep into the various codes of football."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"In England, by the 1890s, a long-standing Rugby Football Union ban on professional players was causing regional tensions within rugby football, as many players in northern England were working class and could not afford to take time off to train, travel, play and recover from injuries. This was not very different from what had occurred ten years earlier in soccer in Northern England but the authorities reacted very differently in the RFU, attempting to alienate the working class support in Northern England. In 1895, following a dispute about a player being paid broken time payments, which replaced wages lost as a result of playing rugby, representatives of the northern clubs met in Huddersfield to form the Northern Rugby Football Union (NRFU). The new body initially permitted only various types of player wage replacements. However, within two years, NRFU players could be paid, but they were required to have a job outside sport."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"Over time, the RFU form of rugby, played by clubs which remained members of national federations affiliated to the IRFB, became known as rugby union."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"The need for a single body to oversee association football had become apparent by the beginning of the 20th century, with the increasing popularity of international fixtures. The English Football Association had chaired many discussions on setting up an international body, but was perceived as making no progress. It fell to associations from seven other European countries: France, Belgium, Denmark, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland, to form an international association. The Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) was founded in Paris on 21 May 1904.[127] Its first president was Robert Guérin.[127] The French name and acronym has remained, even outside French-speaking countries."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"In each of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada, one football code is known solely as ""football"", while the others generally require a qualifier. In New Zealand, ""football"" historically referred to rugby union, but more recently may be used unqualified to refer to association football. The sport meant by the word ""football"" in Australia is either Australian rules football or rugby league, depending on local popularity (which largely conforms to the Barassi Line). In francophone Quebec, where Canadian football is more popular, the Canadian code is known as le football while American football is known as le football américain and association football is known as le soccer.[129]"

https://www.britannica.com/sports/football-soccer,"Modern football originated in Britain in the 19th century. Though “folk football” had been played since medieval times with varying rules, the game began to be standardized when it was taken up as a winter game at public schools. The Football Association, formed in 1863, codified the rules of the game and hosted the first cup competition between regional football clubs in Britain."
https://www.britannica.com/sports/football-soccer,"football, also called association football or soccer, game in which two teams of 11 players, using any part of their bodies except their hands and arms, try to maneuver the ball into the opposing team’s goal. Only the goalkeeper is permitted to handle the ball and may do so only within the penalty area surrounding the goal. The team that scores more goals wins."
https://www.britannica.com/sports/football-soccer,"Modern football originated in Britain in the 19th century. Since before medieval times, “folk football” games had been played in towns and villages according to local customs and with a minimum of rules. Industrialization and urbanization, which reduced the amount of leisure time and space available to the working class, combined with a history of legal prohibitions against particularly violent and destructive forms of folk football to undermine the game’s status from the early 19th century onward. However, football was taken up as a winter game between residence houses at public (independent) schools such as Winchester, Charterhouse, and Eton. Each school had its own rules; some allowed limited handling of the ball and others did not. The variance in rules made it difficult for public schoolboys entering university to continue playing except with former schoolmates. As early as 1843 an attempt to standardize and codify the rules of play was made at the University of Cambridge, whose students joined most public schools in 1848 in adopting these “Cambridge rules,” which were further spread by Cambridge graduates who formed football clubs. In 1863 a series of meetings involving clubs from metropolitan London and surrounding counties produced the printed rules of football, which prohibited the carrying of the ball. Thus, the “handling” game of rugby remained outside the newly formed Football Association (FA). Indeed, by 1870 all handling of the ball except by the goalkeeper was prohibited by the FA."
https://www.britannica.com/sports/football-soccer,"The new rules were not universally accepted in Britain, however; many clubs retained their own rules, especially in and around Sheffield. Although this northern English city was the home of the first provincial club to join the FA, in 1867 it also gave birth to the Sheffield Football Association, the forerunner of later county associations. Sheffield and London clubs played two matches against each other in 1866, and a year later a match pitting a club from Middlesex against one from Kent and Surrey was played under the revised rules. In 1871 15 FA clubs accepted an invitation to enter a cup competition and to contribute to the purchase of a trophy. By 1877 the associations of Great Britain had agreed upon a uniform code, 43 clubs were in competition, and the London clubs’ initial dominance had diminished."

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different parts of the world.[2][3][4] Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at English public schools during the 19th century.[5][6] The expansion and cultural influence of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence outside the directly controlled Empire.[7] By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional codes were already developing: Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order to maintain their heritage.[8] In 1888, The Football League was founded in England, becoming the first of many professional football associations. During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the most popular team sports in the world.[9]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"Games played in Mesoamerica with rubber balls by indigenous peoples are also well-documented as existing since before this time, but these had more similarities to basketball or volleyball, and no links have been found between such games and modern football sports. Northeastern American Indians, especially the Iroquois Confederation, played a game which made use of net racquets to throw and catch a small ball; however, although it is a ball-goal foot game, lacrosse (as its modern descendant is called) is likewise not usually classed as a form of ""football.""[citation needed]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"The Māori in New Zealand played a game called Ki-o-rahi consisting of teams of seven players play on a circular field divided into zones, and score points by touching the 'pou' (boundary markers) and hitting a central 'tupu' or target.[citation needed]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"The Middle Ages saw a huge rise in popularity of annual Shrovetide football matches throughout Europe, particularly in England. An early reference to a ball game played in Britain comes from the 9th-century Historia Brittonum, attributed to Nennius, which describes ""a party of boys ... playing at ball"".[30] References to a ball game played in northern France known as La Soule or Choule, in which the ball was propelled by hands, feet, and sticks,[31] date from the 12th century.[32]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"In 1314, Nicholas de Farndone, Lord Mayor of the City of London issued a decree banning football in the French used by the English upper classes at the time. A translation reads: ""[f]orasmuch as there is great noise in the city caused by hustling over large foot balls [rageries de grosses pelotes de pee][39] in the fields of the public from which many evils might arise which God forbid: we command and forbid on behalf of the king, on pain of imprisonment, such game to be used in the city in the future."" This is the earliest reference to football."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"There is also an account in Latin from the end of the 15th century of football being played at Caunton, Nottinghamshire. This is the first description of a ""kicking game"" and the first description of dribbling: ""[t]he game at which they had met for common recreation is called by some the foot-ball game. It is one in which young men, in country sport, propel a huge ball not by throwing it into the air but by striking it and rolling it along the ground, and that not with their hands but with their feet... kicking in opposite directions."" The chronicler gives the earliest reference to a football pitch, stating that: ""[t]he boundaries have been marked and the game had started.[37]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"While football continued to be played in various forms throughout Britain, its public schools (equivalent to private schools in other countries) are widely credited with four key achievements in the creation of modern football codes. First of all, the evidence suggests that they were important in taking football away from its ""mob"" form and turning it into an organised team sport. Second, many early descriptions of football and references to it were recorded by people who had studied at these schools. Third, it was teachers, students, and former students from these schools who first codified football games, to enable matches to be played between schools. Finally, it was at English public schools that the division between ""kicking"" and ""running"" (or ""carrying"") games first became clear."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"The earliest evidence that games resembling football were being played at English public schools – mainly attended by boys from the upper, upper-middle and professional classes – comes from the Vulgaria by William Herman in 1519. Herman had been headmaster at Eton and Winchester colleges and his Latin textbook includes a translation exercise with the phrase ""We wyll playe with a ball full of wynde"".[50]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"Richard Mulcaster, a student at Eton College in the early 16th century and later headmaster at other English schools, has been described as ""the greatest sixteenth Century advocate of football"".[51] Among his contributions are the earliest evidence of organised team football. Mulcaster's writings refer to teams (""sides"" and ""parties""), positions (""standings""), a referee (""judge over the parties"") and a coach ""(trayning maister)"". Mulcaster's ""footeball"" had evolved from the disordered and violent forms of traditional football:"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"English public schools were the first to codify football games. In particular, they devised the first offside rules, during the late 18th century.[57] In the earliest manifestations of these rules, players were ""off their side"" if they simply stood between the ball and the goal which was their objective. Players were not allowed to pass the ball forward, either by foot or by hand. They could only dribble with their feet, or advance the ball in a scrum or similar formation. However, offside laws began to diverge and develop differently at each school, as is shown by the rules of football from Winchester, Rugby, Harrow and Cheltenham, during between 1810 and 1850.[57] The first known codes – in the sense of a set of rules – were those of Eton in 1815[58] and Aldenham in 1825.[58])"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"Football was adopted by a number of public schools as a way of encouraging competitiveness and keeping youths fit. Each school drafted its own rules, which varied widely between different schools and were changed over time with each new intake of pupils. Two schools of thought developed regarding rules. Some schools favoured a game in which the ball could be carried (as at Rugby, Marlborough and Cheltenham), while others preferred a game where kicking and dribbling the ball was promoted (as at Eton, Harrow, Westminster and Charterhouse). The division into these two camps was partly the result of circumstances in which the games were played. For example, Charterhouse and Westminster at the time had restricted playing areas; the boys were confined to playing their ball game within the school cloisters, making it difficult for them to adopt rough and tumble running games.[citation needed]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"William Webb Ellis, a pupil at Rugby School, is said to have ""with a fine disregard for the rules of football, as played in his time [emphasis added], first took the ball in his arms and ran with it, thus creating the distinctive feature of the rugby game."" in 1823. This act is usually said to be the beginning of Rugby football, but there is little evidence that it occurred, and most sports historians believe the story to be apocryphal. The act of 'taking the ball in his arms' is often misinterpreted as 'picking the ball up' as it is widely believed that Webb Ellis' 'crime' was handling the ball, as in modern association football, however handling the ball at the time was often permitted and in some cases compulsory,[59] the rule for which Webb Ellis showed disregard was running forward with it as the rules of his time only allowed a player to retreat backwards or kick forwards."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"Apart from Rugby football, the public school codes have barely been played beyond the confines of each school's playing fields. However, many of them are still played at the schools which created them (see Surviving UK school games below)."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,The earliest known matches between public schools are as follows:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"Sports clubs dedicated to playing football began in the 18th century, for example London's Gymnastic Society which was founded in the mid-18th century and ceased playing matches in 1796.[64][62]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"The first documented club to bear in the title a reference to being a 'football club' were called ""The Foot-Ball Club"" who were located in Edinburgh, Scotland, during the period 1824–41.[65][66] The club forbade tripping but allowed pushing and holding and the picking up of the ball.[66]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,The earliest known matches involving non-public school clubs or institutions are as follows:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"During the nineteenth century, several codifications of the rules of football were made at the University of Cambridge, in order to enable students from different public schools to play each other. The Cambridge Rules of 1863 influenced the decision of Football Association to ban Rugby-style carrying of the ball in its own first set of laws.[101]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"By the late 1850s, many football clubs had been formed throughout the English-speaking world, to play various codes of football. Sheffield Football Club, founded in 1857 in the English city of Sheffield by Nathaniel Creswick and William Prest, was later recognised as the world's oldest club playing association football.[102] However, the club initially played its own code of football: the Sheffield rules. The code was largely independent of the public school rules, the most significant difference being the lack of an offside rule."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"The code was responsible for many innovations that later spread to association football. These included free kicks, corner kicks, handball, throw-ins and the crossbar.[103] By the 1870s they became the dominant code in the north and midlands of England. At this time a series of rule changes by both the London and Sheffield FAs gradually eroded the differences between the two games until the adoption of a common code in 1877."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"In July 1858, Tom Wills, an Australian-born cricketer educated at Rugby School in England, wrote a letter to Bell's Life in Victoria & Sporting Chronicle, calling for a ""foot-ball club"" with a ""code of laws"" to keep cricketers fit during winter.[104] This is considered by historians to be a defining moment in the creation of Australian rules football. Through publicity and personal contacts Wills was able to co-ordinate football matches in Melbourne that experimented with various rules,[105] the first of which was played on 31 July 1858. One week later, Wills umpired a schoolboys match between Melbourne Grammar School and Scotch College. Following these matches, organised football in Melbourne rapidly increased in popularity."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"Wills and others involved in these early matches formed the Melbourne Football Club (the oldest surviving Australian football club) on 14 May 1859. Club members Wills, William Hammersley, J. B. Thompson and Thomas H. Smith met with the intention of forming a set of rules that would be widely adopted by other clubs. The committee debated rules used in English public school games; Wills pushed for various rugby football rules he learnt during his schooling. The first rules share similarities with these games, and were shaped to suit to Australian conditions. H. C. A. Harrison, a seminal figure in Australian football, recalled that his cousin Wills wanted ""a game of our own"".[106] The code was distinctive in the prevalence of the mark, free kick, tackling, lack of an offside rule and that players were specifically penalised for throwing the ball."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"The Melbourne football rules were widely distributed and gradually adopted by the other Victorian clubs. The rules were updated several times during the 1860s to accommodate the rules of other influential Victorian football clubs. A significant redraft in 1866 by H. C. A. Harrison's committee accommodated the Geelong Football Club's rules, making the game then known as ""Victorian Rules"" increasingly distinct from other codes. It soon adopted cricket fields and an oval ball, used specialised goal and behind posts, and featured bouncing the ball while running and spectacular high marking. The game spread quickly to other Australian colonies. Outside its heartland in southern Australia, the code experienced a significant period of decline following World War I but has since grown throughout Australia and in other parts of the world, and the Australian Football League emerged as the dominant professional competition."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"During the early 1860s, there were increasing attempts in England to unify and reconcile the various public school games. In 1862, J. C. Thring, who had been one of the driving forces behind the original Cambridge Rules, was a master at Uppingham School and he issued his own rules of what he called ""The Simplest Game"" (these are also known as the Uppingham Rules). In early October 1863 another new revised version of the Cambridge Rules was drawn up by a seven member committee representing former pupils from Harrow, Shrewsbury, Eton, Rugby, Marlborough and Westminster."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"At the Freemasons' Tavern, Great Queen Street, London on the evening of 26 October 1863, representatives of several football clubs in the London Metropolitan area met for the inaugural meeting of The Football Association (FA). The aim of the Association was to establish a single unifying code and regulate the playing of the game among its members. Following the first meeting, the public schools were invited to join the association. All of them declined, except Charterhouse and Uppingham. In total, six meetings of the FA were held between October and December 1863. After the third meeting, a draft set of rules were published. However, at the beginning of the fourth meeting, attention was drawn to the recently published Cambridge Rules of 1863. The Cambridge rules differed from the draft FA rules in two significant areas; namely running with (carrying) the ball and hacking (kicking opposing players in the shins). The two contentious FA rules were as follows:"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"IX. A player shall be entitled to run with the ball towards his adversaries' goal if he makes a fair catch, or catches the ball on the first bound; but in case of a fair catch, if he makes his mark he shall not run. X. If any player shall run with the ball towards his adversaries' goal, any player on the opposite side shall be at liberty to charge, hold, trip or hack him, or to wrest the ball from him, but no player shall be held and hacked at the same time.[107]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"At the fifth meeting it was proposed that these two rules be removed. Most of the delegates supported this, but F. M. Campbell, the representative from Blackheath and the first FA treasurer, objected. He said: ""hacking is the true football"". However, the motion to ban running with the ball in hand and hacking was carried and Blackheath withdrew from the FA. After the final meeting on 8 December, the FA published the ""Laws of Football"", the first comprehensive set of rules for the game later known as Association Football. The term ""soccer"", in use since the late 19th century, derives from an Oxford University abbreviation of ""Association"".[108]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"The first FA rules still contained elements that are no longer part of association football, but which are still recognisable in other games (such as Australian football and rugby football): for instance, a player could make a fair catch and claim a mark, which entitled him to a free kick; and if a player touched the ball behind the opponents' goal line, his side was entitled to a free kick at goal, from 15 yards (13.5 metres) in front of the goal line."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"In Britain, by 1870, there were 49 clubs playing variations of the Rugby school game.[109] There were also ""rugby"" clubs in Ireland, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. However, there was no generally accepted set of rules for rugby until 1871, when 21 clubs from London came together to form the Rugby Football Union (RFU). The first official RFU rules were adopted in June 1871.[110] These rules allowed passing the ball. They also included the try, where touching the ball over the line allowed an attempt at goal, though drop-goals from marks and general play, and penalty conversions were still the main form of contest."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"As was the case in Britain, by the early 19th century, North American schools and universities played their own local games, between sides made up of students. For example, students at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire played a game called Old division football, a variant of the association football codes, as early as the 1820s.[48] They remained largely ""mob football"" style games, with huge numbers of players attempting to advance the ball into a goal area, often by any means necessary. Rules were simple, violence and injury were common.[47] The violence of these mob-style games led to widespread protests and a decision to abandon them. Yale University, under pressure from the city of New Haven, banned the play of all forms of football in 1860, while Harvard University followed suit in 1861.[47] In its place, two general types of football evolved: ""kicking"" games and ""running"" (or ""carrying"") games. A hybrid of the two, known as the ""Boston game"", was played by a group known as the Oneida Football Club. The club, considered by some historians as the first formal football club in the United States, was formed in 1862 by schoolboys who played the ""Boston game"" on Boston Common.[47][111] The game began to return to American college campuses by the late 1860s. The universities of Yale, Princeton (then known as the College of New Jersey), Rutgers, and Brown all began playing ""kicking"" games during this time. In 1867, Princeton used rules based on those of the English Football Association.[47]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"In 1880, Yale coach Walter Camp, who had become a fixture at the Massasoit House conventions where the rules were debated and changed, devised a number of major innovations. Camp's two most important rule changes that diverged the American game from rugby were replacing the scrummage with the line of scrimmage and the establishment of the down-and-distance rules.[119] American football still however remained a violent sport where collisions often led to serious injuries and sometimes even death.[120] This led U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt to hold a meeting with football representatives from Harvard, Yale, and Princeton on 9 October 1905, urging them to make drastic changes.[121] One rule change introduced in 1906, devised to open up the game and reduce injury, was the introduction of the legal forward pass. Though it was underutilised for years, this proved to be one of the most important rule changes in the establishment of the modern game.[122]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"Over the years, Canada absorbed some of the developments in American football in an effort to distinguish it from a more rugby-oriented game. In 1903, the Ontario Rugby Football Union adopted the Burnside rules, which implemented the line of scrimmage and down-and-distance system from American football, among others.[123] Canadian football then implemented the legal forward pass in 1929.[124] American and Canadian football remain different codes, stemming from rule changes that the American side of the border adopted but the Canadian side has not."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"By the 1870s, Rugby and Association football had started to become popular in Ireland. Trinity College Dublin was an early stronghold of Rugby (see the Developments in the 1850s section, above). The rules of the English FA were being distributed widely. Traditional forms of caid had begun to give way to a ""rough-and-tumble game"" which allowed tripping."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"There was no serious attempt to unify and codify Irish varieties of football, until the establishment of the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) in 1884. The GAA sought to promote traditional Irish sports, such as hurling and to reject imported games like Rugby and Association football. The first Gaelic football rules were drawn up by Maurice Davin and published in the United Ireland magazine on 7 February 1887.[125] Davin's rules showed the influence of games such as hurling and a desire to formalise a distinctly Irish code of football. The prime example of this differentiation was the lack of an offside rule (an attribute which, for many years, was shared only by other Irish games like hurling, and by Australian rules football)."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"The International Rugby Football Board (IRFB) was founded in 1886,[126] but rifts were beginning to emerge in the code. Professionalism had already begun to creep into the various codes of football."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"In England, by the 1890s, a long-standing Rugby Football Union ban on professional players was causing regional tensions within rugby football, as many players in northern England were working class and could not afford to take time off to train, travel, play and recover from injuries. This was not very different from what had occurred ten years earlier in soccer in Northern England but the authorities reacted very differently in the RFU, attempting to alienate the working class support in Northern England. In 1895, following a dispute about a player being paid broken time payments, which replaced wages lost as a result of playing rugby, representatives of the northern clubs met in Huddersfield to form the Northern Rugby Football Union (NRFU). The new body initially permitted only various types of player wage replacements. However, within two years, NRFU players could be paid, but they were required to have a job outside sport."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"Over time, the RFU form of rugby, played by clubs which remained members of national federations affiliated to the IRFB, became known as rugby union."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"The need for a single body to oversee association football had become apparent by the beginning of the 20th century, with the increasing popularity of international fixtures. The English Football Association had chaired many discussions on setting up an international body, but was perceived as making no progress. It fell to associations from seven other European countries: France, Belgium, Denmark, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland, to form an international association. The Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) was founded in Paris on 21 May 1904.[127] Its first president was Robert Guérin.[127] The French name and acronym has remained, even outside French-speaking countries."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football,"In each of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada, one football code is known solely as ""football"", while the others generally require a qualifier. In New Zealand, ""football"" historically referred to rugby union, but more recently may be used unqualified to refer to association football. The sport meant by the word ""football"" in Australia is either Australian rules football or rugby league, depending on local popularity (which largely conforms to the Barassi Line). In francophone Quebec, where Canadian football is more popular, the Canadian code is known as le football while American football is known as le football américain and association football is known as le soccer.[129]"

https://www.britannica.com/sports/football-soccer,"Modern football originated in Britain in the 19th century. Though “folk football” had been played since medieval times with varying rules, the game began to be standardized when it was taken up as a winter game at public schools. The Football Association, formed in 1863, codified the rules of the game and hosted the first cup competition between regional football clubs in Britain."
https://www.britannica.com/sports/football-soccer,"football, also called association football or soccer, game in which two teams of 11 players, using any part of their bodies except their hands and arms, try to maneuver the ball into the opposing team’s goal. Only the goalkeeper is permitted to handle the ball and may do so only within the penalty area surrounding the goal. The team that scores more goals wins."
https://www.britannica.com/sports/football-soccer,"Modern football originated in Britain in the 19th century. Since before medieval times, “folk football” games had been played in towns and villages according to local customs and with a minimum of rules. Industrialization and urbanization, which reduced the amount of leisure time and space available to the working class, combined with a history of legal prohibitions against particularly violent and destructive forms of folk football to undermine the game’s status from the early 19th century onward. However, football was taken up as a winter game between residence houses at public (independent) schools such as Winchester, Charterhouse, and Eton. Each school had its own rules; some allowed limited handling of the ball and others did not. The variance in rules made it difficult for public schoolboys entering university to continue playing except with former schoolmates. As early as 1843 an attempt to standardize and codify the rules of play was made at the University of Cambridge, whose students joined most public schools in 1848 in adopting these “Cambridge rules,” which were further spread by Cambridge graduates who formed football clubs. In 1863 a series of meetings involving clubs from metropolitan London and surrounding counties produced the printed rules of football, which prohibited the carrying of the ball. Thus, the “handling” game of rugby remained outside the newly formed Football Association (FA). Indeed, by 1870 all handling of the ball except by the goalkeeper was prohibited by the FA."
https://www.britannica.com/sports/football-soccer,"The new rules were not universally accepted in Britain, however; many clubs retained their own rules, especially in and around Sheffield. Although this northern English city was the home of the first provincial club to join the FA, in 1867 it also gave birth to the Sheffield Football Association, the forerunner of later county associations. Sheffield and London clubs played two matches against each other in 1866, and a year later a match pitting a club from Middlesex against one from Kent and Surrey was played under the revised rules. In 1871 15 FA clubs accepted an invitation to enter a cup competition and to contribute to the purchase of a trophy. By 1877 the associations of Great Britain had agreed upon a uniform code, 43 clubs were in competition, and the London clubs’ initial dominance had diminished."

Celui dont la Suisse a terminé en tête. Les Italiens ne maudissent pas la Nati, qui a tenu leur équipe en échec deux fois l’automne dernier, mais bien Jorginho, qui a manqué deux penalties, à l’aller puis au retour."
https://www.letemps.ch/sport/football-italien-retour-bord-gouffre,"La fédération a fait tout son possible pour leur faciliter la tâche. Un stage fin janvier pour tester de nouveaux joueurs ou en rappeler d’anciens comme Mario Balotelli (31 ans), qui évolue en Turquie (Adana Demirspor). L’anticipation d’une semaine de l’autorisation de remplir les stades à 100% pour la première fois depuis le début de la pandémie. Le choix du stade de Renzo Barbera, à Palerme, pour l’enthousiasme des spectateurs avides de football compétitif puisque le club local gît en Serie C. Seul échec: les clubs de Serie A ont refusé de reporter la dernière journée du championnat pour que le rassemblement ait lieu plus tôt."
https://www.letemps.ch/sport/football-italien-retour-bord-gouffre,"Pourtant, le calendrier de ces clubs s’est soudainement allégé. Aucun d’entre eux ne s’est qualifié pour les quarts de finale de la Ligue des champions. Le seul rescapé italien est… Jorginho, milieu de terrain de Chelsea. Depuis 2018, la nouvelle formule de la plus prestigieuse compétition européenne garantit quatre places aux quatre premiers championnats de l’indice UEFA, mais la Serie A n’en profite que modérément. Elle n’a qualifié que 10 représentants sur 16 pour la phase à élimination directe, et seulement 2 sur 10 en quarts."
https://www.letemps.ch/sport/football-italien-retour-bord-gouffre,"A ce stade de la compétition et toujours sur ces quatre saisons, elle est seulement la sixième force européenne derrière l’Angleterre (11 clubs en quarts), l’Espagne (7), l’Allemagne (5), la France et le Portugal (3). La Juventus, tête de gondole du calcio, continue de se faire éliminer par plus petit qu’elle (Ajax, Lyon, Porto et Villarreal) pendant que son président, Andrea Agnelli, s’obstine dans son projet de Super League européenne pour VIP."
https://www.letemps.ch/sport/football-italien-retour-bord-gouffre,"Par pure coïncidence, plusieurs études accablant la santé du football italien sont sorties ces derniers jours. Deloitte a publié le classement annuel de sa Money League, où la Juventus est montée de la 10e à la 9e place avec 433 millions d’euros de revenus annuels mais toujours loin derrière les ténors. L’Inter est 14e, l’AC Milan 18e, mais dès qu’un club n’accède pas à la Ligue des champions et ses primes généreuses, il dégringole, comme le Napoli, désormais 28e."
https://www.letemps.ch/sport/football-italien-retour-bord-gouffre,"La Gazzetta dello Sport, de son côté, a publié mardi une enquête sur les comptes des 20 clubs de Serie A et leur dette globale s’élève maintenant à 3,3 milliards d’euros. Le Covid-19 n’excuse pas tout puisque la masse salariale est passée de 1,6 à 2 milliards d’une saison à l’autre. Or, malgré son économie fragile, la Serie A est le championnat qui a la seconde balance la plus négative du monde sur le marché des transferts depuis 2017. L’Observatoire du football CIES, basé à Neuchâtel, l’évalue à -910 millions, quatre fois moins que la richissime Super League anglaise, mais surtout trois fois pire que la Liga espagnole et dix fois pire que la Bundesliga allemande, ses deux réelles concurrentes."
https://www.letemps.ch/sport/football-italien-retour-bord-gouffre,"Pour limiter la casse, ou sauver les apparences, de nombreux clubs (Juventus, Napoli, Inter) auraient réalisé des plus-values financières fictives via l’échange de joueurs à la valeur gonflée. La justice pénale enquête."
https://www.letemps.ch/sport/football-italien-retour-bord-gouffre,"Enfin, les patrons des clubs de Serie A sont incapables d’avoir une stratégie commune. Neuf présidents, régents ou commissaires de tutelle se sont alternés à la tête de leur ligue depuis 2017. Lorenzo Casini, dernier en date, a ciblé un autre problème majeur dans le Corriere dello Sport: «Nos stades ont 60 ans de moyenne d’âge, et 9 sur 10 n’ont pas une installation énergétique efficace.» L’Italie a quand même proposé sa candidature à l’organisation de l’Euro 2032.

Il fait fantasmer les plus jeunes et réagir les supporters du monde entier. Suivez notre chaine football pour ne rien manquer des dernières actualités."
https://fr.blastingnews.com/news/tag/football/,"Aujourd’hui, le club le plus ancien du monde est Sheffield fondé en 1857. Au fil des années Le football prend peu à peu ses marques en France à la même période. Il devient d’abord extrêmement populaire dans les écoles et les lycées comme jeu des cours de récréation. Le football s’affirme ensuite comme un véritable sport. La première compétition française est mise en place à Paris en 1894. La Fédération française de football a été créé le 7 avril 1919. Pour l'anecdote : on dit du football qu’il est un sport de gentlemen pratiqué par des voyous alors que le rugby serait un sport de voyous pratiqué par des gentlemen."
https://fr.blastingnews.com/news/tag/football/,"Le football est un sport opposant deux équipes de onze joueurs. Chaque équipe compte un gardien de but dont l’objectif est d’empêcher l’équipe adverse de marquer. Le terrain est un rectangle d'une longueur comprise entre 90 et 120 mètres et de largeur comprise entre 45 et 90 mètres. Les matches se déroulent sur un format de 90 minutes, avec deux périodes de 45 minutes. Le vainqueur d’une rencontre est l’équipe inscrivant le plus de buts. Tout comme de nombreux sports, le football s’est adapté aux changements avec des règles éphémères ou liées à l’évolution de la technologie.

https://www.footballhistory.org/,"The first known examples of a team game involving a ball, which was made out of a rock, occurred in old Mesoamerican cultures for over 3,000 years ago. It was by the Aztecs called Tchatali, although various versions of the game were spread over large regions. In some ritual occasions, the ball would symbolize the sun and the captain of the losing team would be sacrificed to the gods. A unique feature of the Mesoamerican ball game versions was a bouncing ball made of rubber – no other early culture had access to rubber. The first known ball game which also involved kicking took place In China in the 3rd and 2nd century BC under the name cuju. Cuju was played with a round ball (stitched leather with fur or feathers inside) on an area of a square. A modified form of this game later spread to Japan and was by the name of kemari practiced under ceremonial forms. Perhaps even older cuju was Marn Gook, played by Aboriginal Australians and according to white emigrants in the 1800s a ball game primarily involving kicking. The ball was made by encased leaves or roots. The rules are mostly unknown, but as with many other early versions of the game keeping the ball in the air was probably a chief feature. Other variety of ball games had been known from Ancient Greece. The ball was made by shreds of leather filled with hair (the first documents of balls filled with air are from the 7th century). Ball games had, however, a low status and was not included at the Panhellenic Games. In the Ancient Rome, games with balls were not included in the entertainment on the big arenas (amphitheaters), but occurred in exercises in the military by the name of Harpastum. It was the Roman culture that would bring football to the British island (Britannica). It is, however, uncertain in which degree the British people were influenced by this variety and in which degree they had developed their own variants."
https://www.footballhistory.org/,"The most admitted story tells that the game was developed in England in the 12th century. In this century, games that resembled football were played on meadows and roads in England. Besides from kicks, the game involved also punches of the ball with the fist. This early form of football was also much more rough and violent than the modern way of playing. An important feature of the forerunners to football was that the games involved plenty of people and took place over large areas in towns (an equivalent was played in Florence from the 16th century where it was called Calcio). The rampage of these games would cause damage on the town and sometimes death to the participants. These would be among the reasons for the proclamations against the game that finally was forbidden for several centuries. But the football-like games would return to the streets of London in the 17th century. It would be forbidden again in 1835, but at this stage the game had been established in the public schools."
https://www.footballhistory.org/,"An attempt to create proper rules for the game was done at a meeting in Cambridge in 1848, but a final solution to all questions of rules was not achieved. Another important event in the history of football came about in 1863 in London when the first Football association was formed in England. It was decided that carrying the ball with the hands wasn't allowed. The meeting also resulted in a standardization of the size and weight of the ball. A consequence of the London meeting was that the game was divided into two codes: association football and rugby. The game would, however, continue to develop for a long time and there was still much flexibility concerning the rules. For one thing, the number of players on the pitch could vary. Neither were uniforms used to distinguish the appearance of the teams. It was also common with players wearing caps – the header was yet to be a part of the game yet. Further reading: The development of football rules. Another important difference at this stage could be noticed between English and Scottish teams. Whereas the English teams preferred to run forward with the ball in a more rugby fashion, the Scottish chose to pass the ball between their players. It would be the Scottish approach that soon became predominant. The sport was at first an entertainment for the British working class. Unprecedented amounts of spectators, up to 30,000, would see the big matches in the late 19th century. The game would soon expand by British peoples who traveled to other parts of the world. Especially in South America and India would the interest in football become big."
https://www.footballhistory.org/,"Football clubs have existed since the 15th century, but unorganized and without official status. It is therefore hard to decide which the first football club was. Some historians suggest that it was the Foot-Ball Club formed 1824 in Edinburgh. Early clubs were often formed by former school students and the first of this kind was formed in Sheffield in 1855. The oldest among professional football clubs is the English club Notts County that was formed in 1862 and still exists today. An important step for the emergence of teams was the industrialization that led to larger groups of people meeting at places such as factories, pubs and churches. Football teams were established in the larger cities and the new railroads could bring them to other cities. In the beginning, football was dominated by public school teams, but later, teams consisting by workers would make up the majority. Another change was successively taking place when some clubs became willing to pay the best players to join their team. This would be the start of a long period of transition, not without friction, in which the game would develop to a professional level. The motivation behind paying players was not only to win more matches. In the 1880s the interest in the game has moved ahead to a level that tickets were sold to the matches. And finally, in 1885 professional football was legalized and three years later the Football League was established. During the first season, 12 clubs joined the league, but soon more clubs became interested and the competition would consequently expand into more divisions. For a long time, the British teams would be dominant. After some decades, clubs from Prague, Budapest and Sienna would be the primarily contenders to the British dominance. As with many things in history, women were for a long time excluded from participating in games. It was not before the late 19th century that women started to play football. The first official women's game took place in Inverness in 1888."
https://www.footballhistory.org/,"Football was for a long time a British phenomenon, but it gradually spread to other European countries. The first game that took place outside Europe occurred in Argentina in 1867, but it was foreign British workers who were involved and not Argentinean citizens."
https://www.footballhistory.org/,"The Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) was founded in 1904 and a foundation act was signed by representatives from France, Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. England and the other British countries did not join FIFA from the start, they had invented the game and saw no reason to subordinate to an association. Still, they joined in the following year, but would not partake in the World Cup until 1950. Domestic leagues occurred in many countries. The first was, as already mentioned, the English Football League which was established in 1888. The leagues would by time expand by more divisions, which were based on team performance. In 1908 would football for the first time be included as an official sport in the Olympic Games. Until the first FIFA World Cup was played in 1930, the Olympic Games football tournament would rank as the most prestigious on a national level. Women's football was not added until 1996."

In 1991 the first World Cup for women was held in China and has since then also returned every fourth year. Today the biggest global tournament for clubs is the Champions League (played since 1992), the former European Cup (1955–1991)."
https://www.footballhistory.org/,"In most parts of the world, football is used as the name for the “chess of the green pitch”, the biggest sport in the world. In the United States and Canada, however, soccer is used instead as a distinction from American football. A more formal name sometimes used is association football, but in popular speech, it is either football or soccer."

More information on this CPR Certification can be found here. CPR Certification is tracked by the school athletic director, similar to the rules meeting-risk management course requirement for assistant and sub varsity coaches. Athletic Directors must confirm (attest) each season through MHSAA.com that both these requirements have been met. If a coaching requirement is not complete prior to the deadline, the school shall prohibit that coach from coaching in that season's MHSAA tournament for the sport involved and shall not be present at the facility where the MHSAA tournament involving that coach's sports team is being held."

This fall will be the 40th anniversary of Jackson’s freshman season at Auburn.

They’re not as fun as the Iron Bowl that’s for sure, but they could determine the future of this rivalry and the further financial impact of college football in the state. “NIL collective” is the new term for a company formed by boosters and fans of a team to raise money for their players, and it’s totally legal. Boosters can’t pay players directly, but their collectives can give money to third-party companies that then distribute that cash in creative ways for the use of a player’s name, image and likeness."

Jimbo Fisher doesn’t want to admit it, but NIL collectives for Texas A&M helped the Aggies land their No.1-ranked recruiting class. Tennessee recently received a commitment from a five-star quarterback in California, and that wasn’t happening before this new age of NIL. The rumor is that the player is in line to receive $2 million per year by way of Tennessee’s NIL collective."

While SEC coaches are forming teams this spring, SEC boosters are forming NIL collectives in the name of school pride. In this league, which they say always means a little more, that’s kind of a scary thought."

https://www.al.com/auburnfootball/2022/03/a-new-era-of-pay-for-play-is-here-for-college-football.html,"On the other hand, perhaps wealthy alums of smaller programs will be more willing to pay for players than they were for coaches and facilities."

https://www.frandroid.com/marques/microsoft/1275477_xbox-part-chausser-les-crampons-sur-les-terrains-du-foot-amateur,"« Power your dreams », clame la tagline de Xbox depuis le lancement des Xbox Series X et Series S. Donner de la puissance à ses rêves, les vivre pleinement ou au moins s’en rapprocher : chez Xbox, cela prend toutes les formes possibles, et surtout pour tout le monde. Depuis longtemps, le jeu vidéo s’y conçoit de manière large, avec une volonté d’inclusivité de tous les joueurs, d’accessibilité, de diversité et de tolérance. Des valeurs qui ont trouvé du répondant auprès de la plus grande instance du football français."
https://www.frandroid.com/marques/microsoft/1275477_xbox-part-chausser-les-crampons-sur-les-terrains-du-foot-amateur,", lâche sans détour Ina Gelbert, directrice Xbox France, à Frandroid lorsqu’on lui demande étonné pourquoi c’est le premier véritable partenariat Xbox en France et pas sur du jeu vidéo. « Quand on regarde autour de nous les différents domaines qui partagent nos valeurs, le sport ressort en priorité et le football encore plus. S’associer à la FFF pour pouvoir agir au niveau local en France nous semblait une suite logique à notre volonté de permettre aux joueurs et joueuses, notamment des clubs amateurs, d’avoir une meilleure expérience de jeu, tout comme on essaye de le faire de notre côté dans le jeu vidéo. »"
https://www.frandroid.com/marques/microsoft/1275477_xbox-part-chausser-les-crampons-sur-les-terrains-du-foot-amateur,"Même si Xbox devient « le partenaire gaming officiel » de la FFF, ne vous attendez pas à voir des logos verts partout autour du terrain durant les matches de équipes de France. Pas plus que de consoles aux abords des stades ou Kylian Mbappé vous vantant les mérites d’Halo Infinite. Le football professionnel n’est même pas concerné au premier chef par cette alliance surprise. « Quand j’entends “gaming”, je pense à des gens qui jouent ensemble et qui se connectent les uns aux autres », souligne la patronne de Xbox France. « Là, c’est le côté gaming pour ses valeurs, pas celui de prendre une manette et de jouer seul sur son canapé »."
https://www.frandroid.com/marques/microsoft/1275477_xbox-part-chausser-les-crampons-sur-les-terrains-du-foot-amateur,"Et François Vasseur, directeur du marketing et du développement économique de la FFF, de renchérir : « Notre mantra à une époque, c’était “la joie de jouer”. Cet ADN du jeu, on le partage. Le gaming n’est en effet pas le cœur du partenariat. L’engagement va bien au-delà et va toucher les gens sur le lien entre les deux domaines. »"
https://www.frandroid.com/marques/microsoft/1275477_xbox-part-chausser-les-crampons-sur-les-terrains-du-foot-amateur,"Et pour y parvenir, les deux partenaires ont noué leur collaboration autour d’actions sur le terrain qui tiennent presque plus du mécénat. Car Xbox va lancer son opération Xbox FC qui vise à donner un coup de pouce aux clubs amateurs en débloquant des fonds pour aider à la rénovation des infrastructures et en modernisant les équipements. « On va donner des moyens au football amateur et aux joueurs de jouer dans les meilleures conditions pour qu’ils puissent, pourquoi pas, accéder à leur rêve et faire éventuellement une carrière professionnelle », explique Ina Gelbert."
https://www.frandroid.com/marques/microsoft/1275477_xbox-part-chausser-les-crampons-sur-les-terrains-du-foot-amateur,"Les modalités du projet et les choix des clubs ne sont pas encore arrêtés, mais devraient. Xbox et la FFF doivent encore formaliser cela avant de lancer les appels à dossier pour les clubs qui voudraient participer. « On ne veut pas que ce soit un one shot. On veut assurer une maintenance et un suivi sur la durée pour que chaque action lancée puisse perdurer », ajoute-t-elle. « On veut avoir un impact local réel avec des effets tangibles et pouvoir se dire qu’on a apporté quelque chose aux clubs sur la durée pour que les efforts initiaux ne soient pas vains. »"

Sa coéquipière en club et en équipe de France, Kadidiatou Diani, et le streamer Domingo seront eux les visages du Xbox Day le 21 mai prochain lors de la finale de l’eCup à Clairefontaine.

L’entreprise y a autant à gagner en termes de notoriété générale que d’image auprès de joueurs souvent acquis à la cause de la concurrence PlayStation via notamment l’incontournable FIFA 22. On s’en défend du côté de la firme, mais c’est un point non négligeable à travers son action, même si ce n’en est pas son cœur. « On veut montrer que la marque Xbox et les actions qu’on décide de mener peuvent avoir un impact local », martèle Ina Gelbert. Les valeurs portées sont réelles depuis des années et elles vont pouvoir s’exprimer en dehors du cercle vidéoludique pour montrer que c’est « plus que du football et du jeu vidéo »."
https://www.frandroid.com/marques/microsoft/1275477_xbox-part-chausser-les-crampons-sur-les-terrains-du-foot-amateur,"Mais l’investissement est bien là pour Xbox dans le football amateur et non dans le sponsoring de l’équipe de France, moyen facile de se faire connaître et de se montrer. « C’est un partenariat, bien plus que du sponsoring », insiste François Vasseur, même si fondamentalement, côté FFF en tout cas, on veut bien parler d’une forme de sponsoring basée avant tout sur un partage de valeurs. « En faisant ces actions, on va avoir un œil positif de millions de licenciés et pratiquants sur notre investissement et nos engagements qui donnent du sens à qui on est aussi. C’est encore plus efficace qu’une communication média qui serait peut-être moins incarnée. »"
https://www.frandroid.com/marques/microsoft/1275477_xbox-part-chausser-les-crampons-sur-les-terrains-du-foot-amateur,"Le partenariat prend acte ce jeudi, mais il n’est que le début, nous assure-t-on. Car d’autres actions sont à venir ensuite, tant les deux acteurs ont de multiples idées en tête. Ils espèrent aussi faire des émules et attirer d’autres partenaires de renom. Car avant le ballon rond, avant la manette, il est avant tout question de communautés de joueurs quels qu’ils soient à sensibiliser à des valeurs sociétales communes autour de la diversité et de l’inclusion. Si cela peut en faire des joueurs de terrain ou de consoles, ce sera toujours ça de pris aussi pour le bien de tous."

Appelé « soccer » en Amérique du Nord, il est pratiqué par 250 millions de joueurs dans plus de 200 pays, ce qui en fait le sport le plus populaire au monde. Il se joue sur un terrain rectangulaire, généralement gazonné, avec un but à chaque extrémité. L’objectif est de marquer en plaçant le ballon dans le but adverse."

Les autres joueurs utilisent principalement leurs pieds pour frapper ou passer la balle, mais peuvent aussi utiliser leur tête ou leur torse. L’équipe qui marque le plus de buts à la fin du match gagne. La durée d’une rencontre est de 90 minutes (deux mi-temps de 45 minutes).

To know more on how enthusiastic America is about football check out top football journalist stories. How will you be celebrating this great American pastime?"
https://nationaltoday.com/american-football-day/,"Rugby and soccer both paved the way for American football in the late 1800s. Yale grad Walter Camp gets the credit for pushing innovative rule changes including the line of scrimmage, down-and-distance rules (i.e. “1st and 10”), and the legalization of blocking. Later, coaches like Knute Rockne and Amos Alonzo Stagg capitalized on the new “forward pass” play. College football took off well before the pro version in the early 1900s as Bowl games attracted a national audience for college teams. The NCAA version remains immensely popular today — with media coverage easily rivaling that of the NFL."

https://www.history.com/news/who-invented-football,"The game has ancient origins, but in the late 19th century, Walter Camp helped shape football—the American kind—into the sport we know today."
https://www.history.com/news/who-invented-football,"The man most responsible for the transition from this rugby-like game to the sport of football we know today was Walter Camp, known as the “Father of American Football.” As a Yale undergraduate and medical student from 1876 to 1881, Camp played halfback and served as team captain, equivalent to head coach at the time. Even more importantly, he was the guiding force on the rules board of the newly formed Intercollegiate Football Association (IFA)."
https://www.history.com/news/who-invented-football,"Thanks to Camp, the IFA made two key innovations to the fledgling game: It did away with the opening “scrummage” or “scrum” and introduced the requirement that a team give up the ball after failing to move down the field a specified yardage in a certain number of “downs.” Among the other innovations Camp introduced were the 11-man team, the quarterback position, the line of scrimmage, offensive signal-calling and the scoring scale used in football today. In addition to his work with the rules board, Camp coached the Yale team to a 67-2 record from 1888 to 1892—all while working as an executive at a watch-manufacturing firm."
